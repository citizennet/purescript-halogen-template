# Purescript Template

We regularly need to run experiments to explore library approaches or have a minimal Halogen playground. This repository serves as a working base for experimentation. You will at least need these tools installed:

- `psc-package` for Purescript package management
- `yarn` for Node package management and scripts

## Use

- `yarn` will install everything you need
- `yarn build` will build the project, start a dev server, and run hot module replacement on save
- `http://localhost:1234` hosts the project when you need to watch those changes
